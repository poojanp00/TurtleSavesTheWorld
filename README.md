# TurtleSavesTheWorld

## General Overview
In the game Turtle Saves the World, ghosts from the PacMan universe have escaped their arcade game and invaded the world! Only our fearless Turtle, armed with a jet pack and and ghost-destroying laser beams, can save us. A complete version of Turtle Saves the World allows players to interactively “fly” Turtle around the screen using input from the keyboard. During the course of the game, Turtle can shoot laser beams at a series of randomly flying ghosts in an effort to eliminate them all and save the world. If Turtle runs into a ghost, she loses a life — Turtle has only three spare lives, so the game will end once she has lost all of her lives or eliminated all of the ghosts.
